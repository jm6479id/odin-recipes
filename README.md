# odin-recipes
<!-- This is the README File for odin-recipes -->
Scope of project was to use html to create webpage with 3-4 recipes, including a home (index) page linking to and from all recipes, image directory with images anchored on each recipe page.

Next optimization should be secure links-complete 6-8-25. ***Is this (rel= "noopener noreferrer")necessary for self directed links?***

6-8-25
Project complete.  Images intentionally broken.  If project resumes, empty img directory, replace with documented open source photography, add references to readme
